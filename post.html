<h2>Why did i chose tech</h2>  
<p>For me there’s a lot of reasons that I shows technology technology for me gives the opportunity to make change but not just any change the light change in the world every major change is made through technology like with healthcare technology save so many lives with feeding people technology say swimming lesson transportation purifying water sustainable energy Technologies a major part in that and I’m very big on innovating and also giving back shit community so my main point in doing technology is just to give back in just to like help people like maybe discover something or company innovation that changes everyone’s life that makes the world a better place that’s very big for me and that’s my main goal for technology to find something that I can use to affect the world to change the world and make it better for the people coming in after me
I also think a common misconception with technology is this it’s everything electronic for me technologies just anything that’s innovative any change like with Egyptians to pyramid was a technological advancement but that has nothing to do with electronics your coding or anything it’s just the air that we’re now it’s mainly based on coding and electrons for any form of innovation for me as tech</p>

   <h2>Why did i chose tech</h2>  
<p>I chose tech because it gave me a outlet to express myself I’m very big into fashion and design and I show that in the way that I dress and I just found text to be an outlet for me to express myself in design I wanna work in front end and you are design and I’m blessed to have this opportunity to Red Hat to do so My family is also major aspects in Me choosing to take is a very nerve-racking feel to get into and having that family support and backing and knowing that I have a support system really motivated me to keep going and to know that I’m capable of doing this so it for me is an outlet to express myself and also an outlet to challenge myself</p>
